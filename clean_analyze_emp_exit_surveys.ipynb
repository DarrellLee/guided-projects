    "## Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). Some modifications have been made to the datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of a data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get started analyzing the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. In a job setting, we'd make sure to meet with a manager to confirm the definitions of the data. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SeparationType**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cease Date**: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DETE Start Date**: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Record ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason for ceasing employment**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)**: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on our initial analysis so far, it would appear that employees that worked seven years or more at the institutes are more likely to resign due to some dissatisfaction, compared to those who worked less than seven years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this guided project was to practice data cleaning task. However we can continue with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide how to handle the rest of the missing values. Then, aggregate the data according to the service_cat column again. How many people in each career stage resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the age column. How many people in each age group resgined due to some kind of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of analyzing the survey results together, analyze each survey separately. Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?"
