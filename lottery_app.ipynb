    "# Mobile App To Estimate Chances Of Winning The Lottery\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guided project, I must assume that a medical institution that treats and prevents gambling addiction, want to build a mobile app that help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a team of engineers that will build the final app, but they have asked my team to build a few functions that calculate probabilities of winning the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "They would like us to create functions that enable users to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "They've also asked that we consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The dataset has records of 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018. You can get access to the dataset on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset)\n",

    "## Probability Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task consist mostly of calculating probabilities, so we'll need tools to help solve probability problems. In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn at random from a set of 49 numbers ranging from 1 to 49. The draws are done without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate probabilities, we need to know how many different combinations we can get when choosing 6(5,4,3 or 2) numbers from a possible set of 49 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the number of combinations when sampling without replacement where order dosen't matter, we'll use this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "_nC_k = {n \\choose k} =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that we'll often need to calculate factorials, so we'll start by creating two core functions, one to calculate factorials and one to calculate combinations"
